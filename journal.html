      <p>Hello from Sydney beach cottage ladies, how the devil are you?  I’m well, though I’ve been on the the poorly side…the less talk of that the better really, hopefully better now…</p>

      <p>I’ve been taking some time around the house the last week or so to do things that never seem to get done…mostly though I have been doing gardening…slowly the garden is getting more, not really sure what the word is…habitable?  There has been a lot of work to do here and it seems though every time I go out there it’s a never ending battle of boring clearing jobs, if you know what I mean…I mean don’t we all just want to plant, water and look at pretty white flowers and harvests of home-grown vegetables?  Well I do anyway.  And although I love nothing better than to get out in the dirt and fresh air, the clearing jobs are wearing thin…and the results never seem to actually look that good either….to be quite honest, am pretty sick of donning gloves and long sleeves because of the many spider’s webs and wondering what I might find in the undergrowth…I’ve yet to find a snake since I’ve been on these shores but the thought of it still makes me quiver.</p>

      <p>Yesterday we spent a long time out there getting rid of years and years (we reckon on about 40 to 50 years worth) of old, ugly and tangled climbing hibiscus…I’ve said before I could quite happily never see an hibiscus again, that feeling has quadrupled now…we also had a guy come in to cut down another load of hibiscus at the back of the garden…he spent a full day in blazing heat, a whole lot of elbow grease on the end of a chain saw and one very large caged in trailer full of old hibiscus to take away…it was the grand total of 3 bushes which had grown as high as the house and were cutting huge amounts of light and air into the garden…apparently they were also rammed full of insects and dead stuff too…it feels wonderful to be rid of them, if less private at the end of the garden (no bringing in the laundry in undies for moi any longer).</p>

      <p>Today I am going to carry on with the clearing…next the beds are on the list, they are full of overgrown old plants, mostly tropical and again, just needing some air and attention…once that is done I may start thinking about putting up a hammock out there…there’s a tropical fruit tree in the middle (which I swing wildly from loving to not loving) that is literally crying out for a hammock and a woman who has been gardening all day to be in it with a beer and a book…I wonder if anyone ever did do that in this garden…. it’s strange, someone at some point obviously put some love into it, I only wish their passion for hibiscus and tropical plants was a little more on the English side and had included perhaps some lavender, the odd rose or even a few herbs would have been nice to inherit.  Mustn’t complain must one as one gardens in the ocean air and sunshine.</p>

      <p>I am also about to tackle the re-planting of an olive tree, brought with us from our other garden…it was hastily plonked at the last minute into a large container and then plonked again in the container into the garden when we arrived here…I literally thought nothing of it (along with my roses) until yesterday while clearing again I came across it…and blow me down with a feather, it’s on the leggy side but it’s thriving!  Very strange as before it was, at best, mediocre…I’ve seen quite a few thriving olive trees around here on my walks, in particular one which is a large tree and laden with olives, so who knows this suburb obviously has the right soil and temps for an olive to do well.  Watch this space, I’ll be bottling my own extra virgin before we know it.</p>

      <p>In other news we have been doing a lot of walks and getting back to nature…this was one of the things on my Improvement List at the beginning of 2016, along with getting to the country more…things have changed for me over the last month or so, I’ve had to really assess what is important to me (and the family) and getting out into nature and taking time with the family before they go off into the big bad world and do their own thing is my first priority and hence why the blog posts have been a bit thin on the ground.</p>

      <p>These pics are from my phone and a couple of walks we did over the weekend…we had the bright idea of going, in 30C heat at midday, on a hike through the bush to a bay only accessible by boat…the walk down was lovely…peaceful and surrounded by nature, wildlife, beautiful Aussie colours and birds…all good and lovely on the way down…there is a small problem when one spends over 30 minutes going downhill….one has to come back up…at one point was beginning to wonder if Mr BC might need to call a helicopter in for oxygen…but with quite a few stops, we made it back up…one way of getting rid of the muffin top I suppose..</p>

      <p>Anyway ladies I am off to deal with that olive bush, do some more gardening, get watering and then make some tea.</p>

      <p>See you next time.</p>
