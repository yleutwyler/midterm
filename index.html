    <p class="label">March 9,2016</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>Ocean, if you were to give, a measure, a ferment, a fruit</p>
		  <p>of your gifts and destructions, into my hand,</p>
		  <p>I would choose your far-off repose, your contour of steel,</p> 
		  <p>your vigilant spaces of air and darkness,</p>
      <p>and the power of your white tongue,</p>
      <p>that shatters and overthrows columns,</p>
      <p>breaking them down to your proper purity.</p>

      <p>Not the final breaker, heavy with brine,</p>
      <p>that thunders onshore, and creates</p>
      <p>the silence of sand, that encircles the world,</p>
      <p>but the inner spaces of force,</p>
      <p>the naked power of the waters,</p>
      <p>the immoveable solitude, brimming with lives.</p>
      <p>It is time perhaps, or the vessel filled</p>
      <p>with all motion, pure Oneness,</p>
      <p>that death cannot touch, the visceral green</p>
      <p>of consuming totality.</p>
    
    <button>Want The Rest?</button>

    <div class="hidden" id="more">

      <p>Only a salt kiss remains of the drowned arm,</p>
      <p>that lifts a spray: a humid scent,</p>
      <p>of the damp flower, is left,</p>
      <p>from the bodies of men. Your energies</p>
      <p>form, in a trickle that is not spent,</p>
      <p>form, in retreat into silence.</p>

      <p>The falling wave,</p>
      <p>arch of identity, shattering feathers,</p>
      <p>is only spume when it clears,</p>
      <p>and returns to its source, unconsumed.</p>

      <p>Your whole force heads for its origin.</p>
      <p>The husks that your load threshes,</p>
      <p>are only the crushed, plundered, deliveries,</p>
      <p>that your act of abundance expelled,</p>
      <p>all those that take life from your branches.</p>

      <p>Your form extends beyond breakers,</p>
      <p>vibrant, and rhythmic, like the chest, cloaking</p>
      <p>a single being, and its breathings,</p>
      <p>that lift into the content of light,</p>
      <p>plains raised above waves,</p>
      <p>forming the naked surface of earth.</p>
      <p>You fill your true self with your substance.</p>
      <p>You overflow curve with silence.</p>

      <p>The vessel trembles with your salt and sweetness,</p>
      <p>the universal cavern of waters,</p>
      <p>and nothing is lost from you, as it is</p>
      <p>from the desolate crater, or the bay of a hill,</p>
      <p>those empty heights, signs, scars,</p>
      <p>guarding the wounded air.</p>

      <p>Your petals throbbing against the Earth,</p>
      <p>trembling your submarine harvests,</p>
      <p>your menace thickening the smooth swell,</p>
      <p>with pulsations and swarming of schools,</p>
      <p>and only the thread of the net raises</p>
      <p>the dead lightning of fish-scale,</p>
      <p>one wounded millimetre, in the space</p>
      <p>of your crystal completeness. </p>
      <p>By: Pablo Neruda</p>
