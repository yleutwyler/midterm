      <p>For Yasmin Leutwyler, the ocean is everything. “This is the only thing I like to do and why I wake up in the morning,” she says.</p>

      <p>Born in New York in 1996, Leutwyler is an olympic-trained swimmer with a stubborn streak and unflappable love for the ocean. “My grandfather and father were both photographers. I decided to follow their path in terms of photography soaking up the color and culture of oceans around the world and center my images on my desire to swim in bodies of water around the world.</p>

      <p>After being rejected by one of Baruch College's best swim teams, I decided to take the semester off to keep training and then joined a different swim team the following semester.</p>

      <p>In 1989, Leutwyler moved to Paris where he apprenticed with photographer Gilles Tapie and rapidly established himself as an editorial photographer. A decade later, Leutwyler moved to New York City.</p>

      <p>Today, Leutwyler’s celebrity portraits can be found in the pages of Vogue, Vanity Fair, the New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Esquire Magazine and Time. He has photographed the likes of Michelle Obama, Julia Roberts, Tom Wolfe, Iggy Pop, Rihanna and Martin Scorsese to name a few.</p>

      <p>Often spare and unflinchingly tight, Leutwyler’s photographs are a quiet yet striking rebuttal to today’s hyper retouched and uber stylized images. “There’s a whole new vocabulary surrounding photography that I find quite vulgar. For me, it’s not about ‘shooting’ and sensationalism,” he says. “It’s a magic moment that happens in the first few minutes of a sitting. Revealing something from out of my subjects that isn’t obvious — finding the beauty within.”</p>

      <p>Leutywler lives and works in downtown Manhattan with his wife and two children.</p>
